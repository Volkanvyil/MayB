  <div class="p1">
The Japanese spider crab is a creeping crawler residing between 50 and 600 meters from the surface, commonly found near Taiwan, but can be seen all over Japan's deep waters. Unlike your typical house spider, this one is big. Very big. If it were to stretch its legs out fully, there would be 3 meters from end to end. With its long arms it has very little trouble getting its pincers in its prey. It eats plant life, shellfish, sea snail and small fish. Dead or alive. The average fully grown spider crab weighs around 19 kilos.

With a lifespan of 100 years, these guys have a lot of time to grow. And grow they do. As they grow bigger and bigger, the hard shell their body is covered in becomes too small for them to stay in. At that point they will leave their shell and wait for a new one to harden around them. This process is called moulting and usually takes around a week to do. During this time period they are very soft and vulnerable to attacks from bigger predators such as stingray and octopuses. As well as having vulnerable phases, their limbs are very fragile throughout its whole life. It is very common to find spider crabs with as many as three or four limbs missing, dragging itself along the sea floor.

The population of the Japanese spider crab is slowly declining, but it has yet to reach the point of endangerment. Japanese folklore depicts these creatures as giant sea monsters that would drag sailors off their ships to never return.
